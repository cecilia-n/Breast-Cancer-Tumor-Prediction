--Creating models with SVM and Random Forest to classify Malignant/Benign Tumors

Breast cancer cells may form tumors, lumps of tissue which can be classified as either malignant or benign, affecting a patientsâ€™ diagnosis and further treatment. A more accurate and timely diagnosis on patient outcomes with machine learning can revolutionize the healthcare industry. Utilizing the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnosis Data Set, we will be classifying malignant and benign tumors. The feature measurements were computed from digital images of breast mass, where the image describes the characteristics of the cell nuclei, such as the mean radius, concavity, perimeter, texture.
